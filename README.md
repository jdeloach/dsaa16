# sparkMLExperiments
Spark experiments used as part as my research at Kansas State University in the Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Lab. Read more about my research at http://jordandeloach.com/.

Research code is just that, research code. Hacked together, barely documented, and rapidly changing. 

# Papers
Elements of this work resulted in a paper that will be published at the International Workshop on Pattern Mining and Applications of Big Data (BigPMA) associated with IEEE Big Data 2016, taking place in Washington, DC.

Additionally, elements of this work resulted in a poster that will be presented at the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-17) Student Abstract and Poster Program in February 2017 in San Fransisco, California.
